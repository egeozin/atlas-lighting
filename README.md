Atlas of Lighting is a joint project between Philips, MIT Center for Advanced Urbanism and MIT Civic Data Design Lab that responds to the need for an integrated and scientific understanding of the dynamics of metropolitan areas around the world. It is an interactive mapping tool in which the user can combine, isolate or cross-reference both quantitative and qualitative datasets to get a clear view of how cities operate. The tool has a potential to create the first comprehensive city dashboard anywhere that digital data exist. While it can be used by researchers and practitioners to identify and analyze socio-spatial processes, it can also be an engagement tool with public and open up new possibilities for participation. 

    This project is designed with: 

    Node.js as Javascript runtime environment +
    Express as backend server  +
    PostGRES for database management +
    D3 and JQuery for frontend state management +
    Docker for container management.
